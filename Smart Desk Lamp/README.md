## Project: ESP32 Smart Desk Lamp with Mood Lighting

This kit guides you through building a smart desk lamp that offers customizable mood lighting. Using an ESP32 microcontroller, you'll learn how to control RGB LEDs, implement different lighting modes, and even connect your lamp to Wi-Fi for smartphone control.

### Key Learning Outcomes:

* **ESP32 Basics*: Understanding the ESP32 development board and its capabilities.
* **PWM Control*: Learning how Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used to control LED brightness and color.
* **RGB LED Control*: Working with addressable RGB LEDs (e.g., WS2812B NeoPixels) for dynamic lighting effects.
* **Wi-Fi Connectivity*: Connecting the ESP32 to your home network.
* **Basic Web Server*: Implementing a simple web server on the ESP32 for remote control via a web browser or a basic app.

### Peripherals Included:

* ESP32 Dev Board
* WS2812B NeoPixel LED Strip (short segment)
* Push Button (for local control)
* Micro-USB Cable
* Breadboard & Jumper Wires
* Custom 3D-printed lamp housing

### Core Functions:

* Cycle through predefined color modes (e.g., solid colors, rainbow, breathing effect) using a push button.
* Adjust brightness of the LEDs.
* Connect to Wi-Fi and allow control of color and brightness via a simple web interface.
* Save last selected mode/color to ESP32 memory.
