## Project: ESP32 Solar Panel Tracker & Power Monitor

This project involves building a system that optimizes solar panel energy capture by tracking the sun and monitoring power generation. An ESP32 will control servo motors to adjust the orientation of a small solar panel, aiming to maximize its exposure to sunlight. The system will also measure the voltage and current produced by the panel to calculate power output and efficiency.

### Key Learning Outcomes:

*   **Solar Energy Principles**: Understanding how solar panels convert light to electricity and factors affecting efficiency (e.g., angle of incidence).
*   **Servo Motor Control**: Precisely controlling servo motors for positioning.
*   **Light Sensing for Tracking**: Using LDRs or other light sensors to determine the optimal direction for the solar panel.
*   **Electrical Measurement**: Using sensors like the INA219 to measure voltage, current, and calculate power from the solar panel.
*   **Algorithm Development**: Creating logic for sun tracking (e.g., comparing light levels from multiple sensors).
*   **Power Optimization**: Exploring strategies to maximize energy harvested.
*   **Data Logging & Display**: Showing panel orientation, power output, and potentially daily energy yield on an OLED display or web interface.

### Peripherals (Conceptual):

*   ESP32 Dev Board
*   Small Solar Panel (e.g., 5V or 6V)
*   Two Servo Motors (for dual-axis tracking - azimuth and elevation)
*   LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors) - typically 4, arranged for directional light sensing
*   INA219 Current/Voltage Sensor Module
*   OLED Display (e.g., 0.96" I2C)
*   Micro-USB Cable
*   Breadboard & Jumper Wires
*   Custom 3D-printed mount for the solar panel and servos.
*   Optional: Battery and charge controller to store harvested energy.

### Core Functions:

*   **Sun Tracking**: Adjust the solar panel's orientation using servo motors based on readings from LDRs to face the brightest light source.
*   **Power Monitoring**: Continuously measure voltage, current, and calculate power generated by the solar panel.
*   **Efficiency Calculation (Conceptual)**: Estimate the efficiency of power generation based on panel specifications and measured output.
*   **Local Display**: Show real-time power metrics, panel orientation, and light sensor readings on the OLED screen.
*   **Web Interface (Optional)**: Host a web server to display live data and potentially control the tracker manually.
*   **Data Logging (Optional)**: Store power generation data over time.
