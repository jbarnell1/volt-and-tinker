## Project: ESP32 Automated Pet Feeder (Indoor)

Never miss a feeding time again! This kit allows you to build an automated pet feeder for indoor use, controlled by an ESP32. You'll learn about controlling motors to dispense food and setting up precise feeding schedules.

### Key Learning Outcomes:

* **ESP32 & RTC*: Using the ESP32 for time-based events and understanding Real-Time Clock (RTC) concepts.
* **Motor Control*: Interfacing with and controlling a servo motor or stepper motor for dispensing food.
* **User Input*: Implementing buttons or a simple interface for setting feeding times.
* **Basic Enclosure Design*: Understanding how the 3D-printed housing integrates with mechanical components.

### Peripherals Included:

* ESP32 Dev Board
* Small Servo Motor (e.g., SG90 or MG996R) or Stepper Motor with Driver
* Push Buttons (for setting feed times/manual feed)
* Small LCD Display (e.g., 16x2 I2C LCD) or OLED for feedback
* Micro-USB Cable
* Breadboard & Jumper Wires
* Custom 3D-printed food hopper and dispensing mechanism housing

### Core Functions:

* Dispense a set amount of pet food at pre-programmed times.
* Allow manual food dispensing via a button press.
* Display current time and next feeding time on the LCD/OLED.
* Store feeding schedules in ESP32 memory.
